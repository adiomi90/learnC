"""
Roman Numeral Dictionary: We start by defining a dictionary called roman_digits,
which maps Roman numerals to their corresponding integer values.
This dictionary is used to look up the value of each Roman numeral character in the input string.

Initialization: We initialize two variables, result and prev_value. 
result will store the final integer value of the Roman numeral,
and prev_value will store the value of the previous Roman numeral character encountered during the iteration.

Iterating Through the String in Reverse: We use a for loop to iterate through the roman_string in reverse order (indicated by [::-1]). 
This reverse order simplifies the logic of comparing Roman numeral values.

Getting the Current Roman Numeral's Value: Inside the loop, we retrieve the integer value of the current Roman numeral character,
char, by looking it up in the roman_digits dictionary and store it in the current_value variable.

Comparing Current and Previous Values: We compare current_value with prev_value to determine whether the current 
Roman numeral should be added or subtracted from the result. If current_value is less than prev_value,
it means we have a situation like "IV" (4) or "CM" (900), where a smaller numeral appears before a larger one,
so we subtract current_value from result. Otherwise, we add current_value to result.

Updating prev_value: After making the comparison, we update prev_value to current_value to prepare for the next iteration.

Returning the Result: Once the loop finishes, we return the result, which contains the total integer value of the Roman numeral string.

This updated code eliminates the need for manually managing an index variable (x) and appending '0' to the string. 
It follows a more natural and intuitive logic based on the rules of Roman numeral conversion, making it both concise and readable. """
